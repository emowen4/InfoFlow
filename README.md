#Info Flow
##Game Abstract:
According to Alvin Toffler:
> information overload occurs when **the amount of input to a system exceeds its processing capacity**. Decision makers have fairly limited cognitive processing capacity. Consequently, when information overload occurs, it is likely that a reduction in decision quality will occur. In daily life, when a person receives an excessive quantity of daily information, the person may have difficulty of understanding an issue and effectively making decisions. 

Our game is a **round-based role-play game** mainly about information overload in Big Data. The game covers four Big Data aspects including variety, volume, velocity, and veracity. Each challenge in the game illustrates one of these four aspects. Three challenges, named *Sort the News*, *Myth Buster* and *Instant Mem*, are provided in the game. The goal of the game is to earn enough money from each challenge and pay off your debt.
